# Precompile-EVM

Precompile-EVM is a repository for registering precompiles to Subnet-EVM without forking the Subnet-EVM codebase. Subnet-EVM supports registering external precompiles through `precompile/modules` package. By importing Subnet-EVM as a library, you can register your own precompiles to Subnet-EVM and build it together with Subnet-EVM.

## How to use

There is an example branch [hello-world-example](https://github.com/ava-labs/precompile-evm/tree/hello-world-example) in this repository. You can check the example branch to see how to register precompiles and test them.

### Generate Precompile Files

First, you need to create your precompile contract interface in the `contracts` directory and build the ABI. Then you can generate your precompile files with `./scripts/generate_precompile.sh --abi {abiPath} --out {outPath}`. This script installs the `precompilegen` tool from Subnet-EVM and runs it to generate your precompile.

### Register Precompile

In `plugin/main.go` Subnet-EVM is already imported and ready to be Run from the main package. All you need to do is explicitly register your precompiles to Subnet-EVM in `plugin/main.go` and build it together with Subnet-EVM. Precompiles generated by `precompilegen` tool have a self-registering mechanism in their `module.go/init()` function. All you need to do is to force-import your precompile packprecompile package in `plugin/main.go`.

### Build

You can build your precompile and Subnet-EVM with `./scripts/build.sh`. This script builds Subnet-EVM, and your precompile together and generates a binary file. The binary file is compatible with AvalancheGo plugins.

### Test

You can create contract tests in `contracts/test` with the Hardhat test framework. These can be run by adding ginkgko test cases in `tests/precompile/solidity/suites.go` and a suitable genesis file in `tests/precompile/genesis`. You can install AvalancheGo binaries with `./scripts/install_avalanchego_release.sh` then run the tests with `./scripts/run_ginkgo.sh`

## Changing Versions

In order to upgrade the Subnet-EVM version, you need to change the version in `go.mod` and `scripts/versions.sh`. You can also change the AvalancheGo version through `scripts/versions.sh` as well. Then you can run `./scripts/build.sh` to build the plugin with the new version.

Furthermore, for developers using the provided DevContainer, you will also need to change the version of AvalancheGo built by the container. This can be done by modifying the following line in `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`:

```
RUN git clone -b v1.10.5 https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego
```

In particular, you will want to change `v.1.10.5` to whichever version of AvalancheGo you want to change to.

## AvalancheGo Compatibility
